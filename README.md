First, follow the instructions in libraries/combat_env/README.md before following the instructions in this README. Once you have sigma_graph and its dependencies installed, follow these instructions to run the tsp/attention model tests.

# setup
If on Linux:

1. make sure that this project is root folder
2. run ./setup.sh

If on Anaconda:

1. conda env create --name <env_name> -f environment.yml
2. conda activate <env_name>

If that doesn't work:

1. make sure that figure8squad/attention_study is root folder
2. run the following commands (or their analogues for your OS):
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd libraries/combat_env
pip3 install -e .
```

# running tests
You can also define your own experiments in the experiments.json file and run them with run_experiments.py.

**To run baseline tests:**
`python3 train.py`

Currently, only baselines for ppo are used because the gat model only performs well using ppo. ~and a2c are being used while some issues with pg and dqn are being worked out -- however, previous tests with pg and dqn trainers showed results consistent with baseline_values.png.~

**To run the tsp/attention model tests:**
discontinued since the ALTR model is not in use currently.

# seeing metrics
You must run tensorboard to see metrics generated by the above commands. The easiest way to do that is to run:
`tensorboard serve --logdir logs_directory`

`logs_directory` varies based on which tests you run.

For baseline metrics, the logs are stored at ~/ray_results/


(discontinued) ~For the tsp/attention model tests, the logs are stored at attention_study/logs/~
